A bunch of Fabric commands we use all the time
==============================================

This package contains a selection of Fabric command we use all the time. By
sharing them online we hope to save someone some time researching how certain
Plone-oriented tasks are performed with Fabric. Commands contain some hardcoded
internal stuff, so they are not really usable out-of-the-box, more so as a
point of reference. If there is interest, we'll rewrite them to be more
reusable.

Some of commands available (see their docstrings for usage help):

* configure_nginx
* prepare_buildout
* run_buildout
* upload_data
* download_data
* start_supervisord
* upload_sphinx

See `docs/README.rst <https://github.com/nzupan/niteoweb.fabfile/blob/master/docs/README.rst>`_ for more info.
